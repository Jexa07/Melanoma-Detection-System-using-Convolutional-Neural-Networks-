ðŸ§¬ Melanoma Cell Detection & Segmentation using YOLOv11m-seg
This repository contains a comprehensive deep learning pipeline for detecting and segmenting melanoma cells from histopathological whole-slide images using YOLOv11m-seg, a cutting-edge extension of the YOLO architecture. The system enables real-time and highly accurate analysis of 256Ã—256-pixel image tiles generated from SVS (Aperio) formatted slides.

ðŸ“Œ Project Description
This project aims to streamline and enhance the melanoma detection process through automated analysis of pathology images. By integrating the YOLOv11 segmentation model, the solution supports:

Accurate melanoma cell detection.

Fast and scalable inference.

Annotation-supported training with robust data augmentation.

The pipeline was implemented, trained, and tested entirely within Google Colab, utilizing GPU acceleration and integrated Drive storage.
